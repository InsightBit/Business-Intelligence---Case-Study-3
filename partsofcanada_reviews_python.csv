Ordered a part online on March 30th. Received an email on April 1 saying it was shipped.April Fools!Called on April 9th. “Oh David I’ve tried to call you many times and also emailed you but you haven’t responded.”“Well I’m calling you from the phone you say you called and I only see the email falsely claiming that the product was shipped. I only live 4 hours away so I figured it would have arrived by now.”“It appears that it is backordered so we will have to contact the manufacturer. It will probably be 3-4 weeks.”Parts of Canada sits on a throne of lies.,1,David Donaldson,Positive,1745120647.771049
"Ordered a part through eBay listed with the part number.  I received and is not the correct part, but this seller listed as so, and stated no refunds.  I wrote a negative review.  A company employee contacted me to change my review and would refund my purchase price. I did change and wrote a generic review.  Since then, seller cannot be contacted, of course!  Research company on Canada BBB!",1,Paul Witscheber,Negative,1745120647.771465
Purchased a replacement igniter for my gas Samsung oven. The part came well packaged and undamaged. Installed in less than 10 minutes and my oven works like new.,5,Andrew Vindini,Negative,1745120647.7716942
This company is the worst. Their customer service is horrible. No one returns your emails. No one wants to listen to what you're saying. If you notice they don't even have Google reviews because they don't even want to be on google. All their reviews on here that are good are  fake. Go to Reddit and look at their reviews there. Stay far away from this company. I bought an inverter board from them and it was worse than the one I was replacing. They kept telling me that I have to bring a professional to look at the refrigerator. However they didn't realize that I'm the one fixing the refrigerator and told them that this innverter board is giving me a problem. As soon as I bought a used one which was OEM for that refrigerator my refrigerator worked perfectly. They did not want to make good for the part,1,John Davis,Negative,1745120647.7723908
"I supplied the model number for my dishwasher and they determined which part I needed. I received it promptly, opened the box and immediately determined that it was the wrong part. I did not try to install it as it was obvious that it was wrong. I put it back in the box that it came in and paid the shipping fee to return it within two days of receiving it. This is their response…We regret to inform you that our supplier has rejected the return of the item because it was received without its original box. As stated in our return policy, all returns must include the original packaging.Unfortunately, without the original box, we cannot proceed with the refund. We understand this may cause inconvenience, and we appreciate your cooperation.If you can provide the original box, Once we receive the original box, we will promptly process your refund.Thank you for your understanding.I have responded twice and got the same seemingly automated response. Totally unacceptable!!!",1,Mike Boehm,Positive,1745120647.773036

"See my review from October of 2024. I sent back the original part which they sent me in error. I was assured I would get a refund for their error. Not only did they not refund my money, they kept the new part I sent back. They said it was not returned in the original box. Really?This company stole my money.

"I just got your e-mail asking for an honest review of my experience working with your company.The initial reason for my contact was to find a part for my DCS Fisher Pakyel . I’ve had very little luck finding a company in the USA that had the right part or , as in the case of most the ones I actually talked to knew anything about what I needed . Your on line parts catalog had the right part that had a number different catalog number then the one I had, but it said it would also work.So I bought it. The part was delivered quicker than I expected and worked great. I think you’ll have more of my business should anything else go wrong, not only with my range but  any other appliance . I noticed you had many parts for a variety of appliances.Thanks again Leo Brady",4,Leo Brady,Positive,1745120647.774645

First deal with Parts of Canada was about a year ago.Have a Samsung fridge that had a number of issues. First was the main cooling unit freezing up to a big block of ice. Looked at fixes & the Parts of Canada kit looked like the best chance to fix the issue. It has work flawless since installing their solution for the problem.  This fridge also had an ice maker that was basically useless. Would freeze up every couple of weeks. I tried every suggested fix the internet & Samsung had for this problem. Got it to a point of lasting longer ( maybe a month between having to thaw it out ). Parts of Canada came up with a fix for the problem this past summer.  I installed the kit in about 3 to 4 months ago & still no sign of any ice buildup in the unit. I finally like my fridge thanks to Parts of Canada.,5,Dennis,Positive,1745120682.985517

Do not buy from this company. This company is a scam. Completely dishonest. Ordered a part and it was broken. They tried to make me pay return shipping and charge me a restocking fee on a broken part they sent. After a month of back and forth they agreed to refund me. I sent the broken part back and then they refused to refund me. After another 2 weeks they said they refunded me and that was a total lie. Had to file a chargeback with Visa.

Beware of this company. These people are scammers. They sent a broken part and tried to charge me for return shipping and restock fee on the broken part they sent. After 2 weeks of trying to get some customer service they agreed to refund me if I sent the part back. When they got the part back they refused to refund me. Now I have to deal with a chargeback with my credit card company. These people are straight crooks. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SHAM COMPANY,1,Benny,Negative,1745120695.014206

The customer support gave me a huge runaround.This company will never refund, only exchange, even it is new in the box.",1,Andrei Volintiru,Positive,1745120695.014933
"Don’t make a mistake at all because you can’t return anything. Even if all you did was look at it and left it in the box. Then they tried to tell me which part I needed, which would have also been wrong. So I would have been double screwed. I also had made an order previously and then cancelled it as I fixed the issue. I had ordered and canceled 10 minutes later. They told me it would take up to 15 business days. We are not at 20 days or so, with no return. Now I have to go chase them down for it again. I do not at all recommend this company. They don’t deserve your money.",1,Diez,Negative,1745120695.015508
Cant give a low enough.  Dont waste your money.  They claim all parts are in stock then call and tell you they are on backorder.  Cancelled order and been waiting for a refund for months.  Customer service is useless.  Fraudulant company.  Order from trusted companies not this one,1,Brian Anstey,Negative,1745120695.0158741

Don't waste your time. I ordered a heating element for a stove and they sent me a part that was missing the terminals completely. They send parts that are damaged and not new. After requiring the cost of shipping for the product and fees and shipping for the return you basically pay for most of the item and get nothing.,1,Shooter McGavin,Positive,1745120695
